Express

Express, is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It is designed to make it easier to build web applications and APIs, widely used for building server-side applications.
Key features:
1- Rotuing: Express provides a simple and expressive way to define routes for handling HTTP requests.
2- Middleware: Middleware can be added to the request-response cycle to perform actions before or after the actual route handling.
3- Template engines:  While Express itself does not include a template engine, it is often used in conjunction with template engines like Pug, EJS, or Handlebars to dynamically generate HTML on the server.
4- Static file serving: Express makes it easy to serve static files (e.g., images, stylesheets, scripts) through built-in middleware, simplifying the process of delivering static content to clients.
5- Rquest and response handling: Express simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses, providing methods for setting headers, sending responses, parsing request bodies, and more.
6- RESTful APIs: Express is commonly used to build RESTful APIs, allowing developers to create robust and scalable server-side applications for handling data and communication between clients and servers.
7- Middleware ecosystem:  Express has a rich ecosystem of middleware modules that can be easily integrated to add additional functionality to your application, such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

Routes: routes allow us to send and receive data depending on which route and HTTP method we use.

RESTful API: REST, or representational state transfer, is an architecture for creating a web service like an API.

HTTP methods: 
1- POST: submit data to the specified resource, often causing a change in the server.
2- GET: retrieves a resource form the server.
3- DELETE: deletes a specified resource. 
4- PUT: replaces a specified resource with a payload. 

Eg: 
First argument: path
second argument: callback (req,res)=>{}

app.get('/', (req, res) => 
res.sendFile('index.html'));

app.get('/api/reviews, (req,res) =>
res.json(reviewData));

app.post('/ api/review, (req,res) => 
    {
        const newReview = req.body
        writeToFile(destination, newReview)
        res.json(`${req.method} recieved`)   
    }
);

Client-side requests: use the Fetch API to maque requests to the express server.
The Fetch API provides a more powerful and flexible way to work with HTTP requests compared to older alternatives like XMLHttpRequest.
Fetch GET request:

fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the data from the successful response
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors during the fetch operation
    console.error('Fetch error:', error);
  });

The Fetch API supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and allows customization of headers, request and response types, and more.

Fetch POST request: 

fetch('https://api.example.com/post-data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    // Add any other headers as needed
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    key1: 'value1',
    key2: 'value2'
    // Include any data you want to send in the request body
  })
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));

Headers: HTTP headers are components of an HTTP request or response that provide additional information about the request or response.
Like authorization, date and content type, etc. 

Resolving requests: 
Request myst be concluded to prevent the client application from hanging indefinitely. 
Methods attatched to the response object allow us to conclude a request-response cycle. 

app.put('api/pets/:pet_id, (req,res) => {
    //Logic to update pet
    res.json('Pet updated')
});

11-01 (Setup):
Create file: server.js
npm install express
public folder
node server.js

11-03 (API-HTML-Routes):
app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    term: 'api',
    description:
      'An application programming interface, is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries',
  });
});

11-05 (Query-params):
Query parameters, also known as query strings or URL parameters, are a way to pass data to a web server as part of a URL. They are commonly used in HTTP requests, particularly in the context of web development and APIs.
Query parameters are appended to the end of a URL and consist of key-value pairs separated by ampersands (&). 

fetch('https://api.example.com/data?category=tech&limit=10')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));

11-07 (GET-Fetch):
Index.js file inside of public folder, thats the script that runs client side. 

11-09 (Static-assets):
server.js`, we can accomplish the same functionality by implementing static middleware.
* Make sure that you have nodemon installed globally. To check run `nodemon --version`. If the command isn't found, run `npm i -g nodemon`
Next, we start `server.js` file by running `nodemon server.js`
In the code, point out the simplicity of the [static middleware](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.static) approach.

11-11 (Insomnia):
Use thunder client instead. (VS code extensions for server requests).

11-13 (POST requests):
file postRequests.js

11-15 (Body parsing):
// Middleware for parsing application/json and urlencoded data
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

POST request with thunder client, BODY has to be JSON

11-17 (POST-fetch, Helpers):
"helpers" typically refer to utility functions or middleware that aid in the development of web applications by providing common functionalities, simplifying code, or enhancing the capabilities of the Express framework.
1-Middleware functions: Have acces to the equest, response cycle and are used for authentication, loggin, error handling and more. 
2- Third party middleware: External modules like body parsers, cookie parses and compression middleware. 
3- View helpers: Used for template engines like handlebars.
4- Error handlin: For managing errores.
5- Routing helpers: Assist in defining and managing routes. 

const PORT = 3001;
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.listen(PORT, () =>
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${PORT} ðŸš€`)
);

11-19 (Data-persistance):

In the context of Express.js, data persistence typically refers to the ability of an application to store and retrieve data across multiple requests or sessions.

1- In-memory storage: store data in memory during the lifetime of the application.
2- Session storage: using middleware such as "express-session". Data is typically stored on the server, and a session ID is sent to the client to identify the session.
3- Database storage: For more robust and persistent data storage, you can use databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. Using an ORM like Sequelize. 

In-memory storage is simple but doesn't persist across server restarts, session storage is suitable for user-specific data, and database storage is suitable for large-scale and persistent data.

// POST request to add a review
app.post('/api/reviews', (req, res) => {
  // Log that a POST request was received
  console.info(`${req.method} request received to add a review`);
  // Destructuring assignment for the items in req.body
  const { product, review, username } = req.body;
  // If all the required properties are present
  if (product && review && username) {
    // Variable for the object we will save
    const newReview = {
      product,
      review,
      username,
      upvotes: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
      review_id: uuid(),
    };
    // Convert the data to a string so we can save it
    const reviewString = JSON.stringify(newReview);
    // Write the string to a file
    fs.writeFile(`./db/${newReview.product}.json`, reviewString, (err) =>
      err
        ? console.error(err)
        : console.log(
            `Review for ${newReview.product} has been written to JSON file`
          )
    );
    const response = {
      status: 'success',
      body: newReview,
    };
    console.log(response);
    res.status(201).json(response);
  } else {
    res.status(500).json('Error in posting review');
  }
});

11-21 (Modular routing):
Modular routing in web development, exemplified by Express.js, involves organizing routes into separate, reusable modules. This practice enhances code organization, separates concerns, and facilitates scalability. Using the express.Router class, developers create modular route files, allowing for a cleaner structure and improved maintainability in large applications. 

11-23 (Custom middleware):
Developers can create their own middleware functions by defining a function with the signature (req, res, next).

1- Creation of custom middleware:
// Custom middleware
const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  // Do something with the request or response
  console.log('Middleware executed');
  // Call the next middleware in the stack
  next();
};

2- Integration with Express Applicaction: "app.use" method.
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Using custom middleware globally
app.use(myMiddleware);

// Applying middleware to a specific route
app.get('/example', myMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Middleware!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});

11-25 (Heroku):

Heroku is a cloud platform that enables developers to deploy, manage, and scale applications easily. It abstracts away much of the complexity associated with infrastructure management and allows developers to focus on building and deploying their applications.

Heroku simplifies application deployment with an easy-to-use platform, abstracting infrastructure complexities. It supports various languages, offers seamless scaling, provides a range of managed services, and integrates with Git for straightforward deployments. Its user-friendly interface, add-ons marketplace, and free tier make it an efficient and developer-friendly choice for hosting and managing applications.
