NodeJS

Full stack: Includes the suite of tools required to build both the front end and back ends of a web application.

Client-side: HTML, CSS and JavaScript, also client side APIs. A client is a piece of computer hardware or software that makes requests to a server.

Server: Depending on the context, a server is both the physical hardware and the software that hears requests from users and returns something, like an HTML or image file, or completes a process.

Client-server model: In modern web applications, there is constant back-and-forth communication between the visuals displayed on the userâ€™s browser (the front end) and the data and logic stored on the server (the back end). Clients make requests, and servers respond.

NodeJS: Node.js is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment designed to be run outside of the browser.
It is a general utility that can be used for a variety of purposes including asset compilation, scripting, monitoring, and most notably as the basis for web servers.

09-01(Node demo):
Open terminal
check node version: node -v
run script: node script.js

09-03 (Arrow-function):
// We can safely swap out function expressions with arrow functions most of the time
var createGreeting = (message, name) => {
  return message + ", " + name + "!";
};
// If the arrow function body contains only one expression, we can omit the curly braces and auto return it
var createGreeting = (message, name) => message + ", " + name + "!";

09-05 (Let-Const):
Const: 
// 1. const can be used for values which we will not reassign
// 2. const doesn't mean `constant value`, instead means `constant reference`
// 3. While we can MODIFY arrays and objects that are using `const`, we can't reassign them

Let:
// 1. When using var, our counter exists after a for-loop is done.
// When using let, our counter is not defined outside of the for-loop block
// 2. When using while loops, any values we create inside exist outside of the while-loop block
// 3. When using let, values defined inside of the while-loop block don't exist outside of it.
Basically let is limited to a smaller scope.

09-07 (Functional loops):
// forEach is a functional way of iterating through an array without a for-loop
  moviePatrons.forEach(patron => console.log(patron.age));

// Filter returns a new array containing only elements whose callback returns a truthy value
  const canWatchRatedR = moviePatrons.filter(function(patron) {
    return patron.age > 17;
  });

//In JavaScript, the .map() method is a higher-order function that is used to transform elements of an array. It creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on each element of the original array. The original array remains unchanged.

09-09 (Template literals):
Template literals are enclosed by backticks ( ) instead of single or double quotes.
1- String Interpolation: You can embed expressions or variables directly within the string using ${} syntax. The expressions inside ${} are evaluated, and their results are inserted into the string.
    const name = 'John';
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, John!
2- Multiline Strings: Template literals make it easy to create multiline strings without the need for explicit newline characters. 
3- Expression Evaluation: Template literals allow the evaluation of JavaScript expressions within the ${} placeholders.
    const num1 = 5;
    const num2 = 10;
    const result = `The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${num1 + num2}.`;
    console.log(result); // Output: The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.

09-11(Process-argv):
In Node.js, process.argv is an array that contains command-line arguments passed to the Node.js process. The process object is a global object in Node.js that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.

09-13(Read/write file):
// fs is a Node standard library package for reading and writing files
const fs = require('fs');
node myscript.js yourValue

09-15(Modularization):
// module.exports is an object we use to store variables or methods
module.exports = {
  pie,
  predictable,
};
Next file calls for the object/module and can access it's data:
const badmath = require('./badmath.js');
console.log(badmath.pie);

09-17 (npm):
Node Package Manager, is the default package manager for JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to easily install, share, and manage dependencies.
npm install package-name
2- Dependency Management: npm helps manage project dependencies by creating and maintaining a package.json file in the project directory. This file lists the project's dependencies and their versions.
run: npm init to create package.json

09-19 (Inquirer):
Inquirer is a Node.js library for creating command-line interfaces (CLIs) with a simple and intuitive way to interact with users.
1- Question Types: Inquirer supports various question types, such as text input, multiple-choice, confirmations, password input, and more.
2- Customization: Developers can customize the appearance of the prompt, add validation for user input, and provide default values.
3- Asynchronous Prompts: Inquirer is designed to work asynchronously, making it suitable for use in Node.js applications where non-blocking interactions are crucial.
4- Sequencing: Developers can use Inquirer to sequence and chain multiple prompts together, creating a series of questions for the user.
Error (Cannot use import statement outside a module):
Option 1: Rename to .mjs
Rename your file from promptExample.js to promptExample.mjs:

09-21 (for-of loop):
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code to be executed for each iteration
}

09-23 (rest-and-spread):
Rest and spread are two features in JavaScript that involve the use of three dots (...). They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.
Rest: The rest syntax is used to collect the remaining elements of an iterable (like an array) into a single variable. 
Spread: The spread syntax, on the other hand, is used to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into individual elements.

09-25 (Object destructuring):
Object destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from objects and assign them to variables in a concise and readable way.
Syntax: const { property1, property2 } = object;
function exampleFunction({ property1, property2 }) {
  // Function logic using property1 and property2
}
