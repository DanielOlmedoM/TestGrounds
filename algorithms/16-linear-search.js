## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/linear-search.js](Unsolved/linear-search.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file that you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `linearSearch()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the index of the given `target` number in the given `arr` array.

    * If the `target` number is not present in the given `arr` array, return `-1`.

    * See the following array and target number for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [82, 22, -4, 21, 1, 8];
      var target = 8;
      ```

    * Given the preceding array and target number, the following number should be returned:

      ```js
      5
      ```
*/

// Write code to create a function that accepts an array of numbers and a target number
// if the target number is present in the array, return its index
// else return -1
// You may not use the `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf` or `includes` methods

var linearSearch = function(arr, target) {};
