# Factorial
## Instructions
* Open [Unsolved/factorial.js](Unsolved/factorial.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.
  * In this file, you will be writing code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following:
    * Return the factorial of the given `num` integer.
    * See the following code for an example:
      ```js
      var num = 3;
      ```
    * Given the preceding number, the following should be returned:
      ```js
      6;
      // 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
      ```
*/

// Write code to create a function that returns the factorial of `num`

var factorial = function(num) {};
