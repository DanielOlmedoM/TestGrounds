## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/is-unique.js](Unsolved/is-unique.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file that you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will write code in the body of the `isUnique()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return `true` if no number appears more than once in the given array; else, return `false`.

    * See the following array for an exampl:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 4, 5, 7, 9]; // no number is repeated
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the following should be returned:

      ```js
      true
      ```
*/

// Write code to create a function that accepts an array numbers
// Return `true` is no number appears in the array more than once, else return `false`

var isUnique = function(arr) {};
