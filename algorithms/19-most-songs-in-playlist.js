/* 
## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/most-songs-in-playlist.js](Unsolved/most-songs-in-playlist.js) in your code editor -- this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  * In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `mostSongsInPlaylist()` function to achieve the following:

    * Return the maximum number of elements present in the array, with a maximum sum of 60.

    * See the following array for an example:

      ```js
      var arr = [3, 4, 7, 2]; // 4 element array
      ```

    * Given the preceding array, the sum of `3`, `4`, `7`, and `2` is `16`, which is less than 60. All elements are used, so the answer is `4`.

    * See the following array for another example:

      ```js
      var arr = [4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7, 3, 2, 3]; // 19 element array
      ```
      */

    // Write code to create a function that accepts an array of numbers
// Each number represents the duration of a song in minutes
// Return the maximum number of songs from the list that can fit in a 60 minute playlist

var mostSongsInPlaylist = function(arr) {
    // add your code here...
  };
