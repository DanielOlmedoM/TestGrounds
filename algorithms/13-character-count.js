/* ## Instructions

- Open [Unsolved/character-count.js](Unsolved/character-count.js) in your code editor&mdash;this is the only file you will modify in this activity.

  - In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `characterCount` function to achieve the following:

    - Create a new object.

    - Loop through each character in the given string and create a new key for each character in the string.

    - The value of the character's key should be the number of times it appears in the string.

    - See the following function for an example:

      ```js
      var str = "Hello World!";
      ```

    - Given the preceding function, the following object should be returned:

      ```js
      { H: 1, e: 1, l: 3, o: 2, ' ': 1, W: 1, r: 1, d: 1, '!': 1 }
      ```
      */

      // Write code to create a function that accepts a string and returns an object containing the number of times each character appears in the string

var characterCount = function(str) {};
